# Flightdeck

[Terraform] modules for rapidly building production-grade Kubernetes clusters
with built-in support for SRE best practices.

These modules are provided by thoughtbot. These are the modules we use when
following SRE practices for our clients. We can help you scale your application,
improve stability, and increase the rate of defect-free deployments. You can
learn more on the [thoughtbot website].

<!-- Are these TF modules, and are the Helm charts all loosely coupled?  If there are necessary tight couplings, either in TF deployments of grouped modules or in dependant charts, how would the implementer understand these nuances? As an example, are Prometheus or Istio optional, while secrets management is assumed to be required? -->

## Deployment

- [AWS](./aws/README.md)
<!-- Does "Other" intend to cover all targets that are not AWS, such as GCP with GKE and Azure with AKS, in addition to bare metal K8s? Or is it intended for non CSP managed instances (e.g. GCP and Azure would have variations of AWS, and "Other" would be unmanaged infra"). -->

## Development
<!-- How would a technical audience get started?  Is there a minimal deployment and/or simple steps one could perform to get their feet wet? -->
